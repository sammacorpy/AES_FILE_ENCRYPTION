# Cool file distribution and AES encryption

This project was one of my experiment which results high satisfaction to my soul.

I love linux and I love terminal so I developed this encryption system to hide my super secret on going projects

This project has programs for both encryption and decryption of the files

# Features:
    1. choose your folder to encrypt and it will encrypt all its data and distribute to 10 different folders located in your system
    2. it will return a hashed file which is used to decrypt that given file.

# Tech used:
    1. python
    2. AES encryption module.
    
    
# how to run 
    install python
    open the .py files in idle and run the program.
